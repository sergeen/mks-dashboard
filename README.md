# MKS Dashboard

This repository contains all the Making Sense Front-end challenge code as provided in October 2022.

I don't include the challenge description and files supplied by MKS, but the code contains all the fixes and changes discussed during the defense interview as part of the company's feedback.

I don't recommend copying it since MKS does a detailed review of the code, including commits, but it can be a good starting point. Also, consider that I extended the code as a personal challenge adding a lot of logic that is not asked in for the interview and can require a significant amount of time to implement.
